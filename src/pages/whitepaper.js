            “Crisis is an opportunity riding on a dangerous wind,”

Prolegomenon
</p>
<p>
 Innovation is forged under pressure and crises in technology are opportunities for evolutions into niche ecologies. The strain on abstract financial machines in the late 20th century was one such crisis. The centralized panic that resulted from the 2007–08 market crash was another. Centralized vertical systems expose constituents to risks they cannot often foresee. The soil of the fallen tree of the 2008 crash was the perfect combination for Bitcoin to manifest and for the dreams of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to begin actualizing.
</p>
<p>
    Cryptocurrency now boasts a value of more than $350 billion. But the innovation of Bitcoin and the technology that allows it — blockchain — goes beyond abstract finance and into the realm of ideas. The vertical ceilings of bulky bureaucracies that manage traditional flows of currency and decision making processes have stagnated the generation of new income potentials as well as new ideas. Power structures are hidden inside of power structures with decisions being made far from the grounding nature of utility. This is the unique problem of our time.
</p>
<p>
    Telikos represents a movement past this stagnation towards a whole ecosystem based on ideas. We propose a self-driving and virtuous incentive mechanism that creates open venture capital for algorithms. Exchanging energy, creating dreams, manifesting them to sustain the people that make it. Harnessing that dangerous wind to create true value and innovation separate from poisonous, parasitic hierarchies by implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
We offer a stabilizing force. Ease. From the void, our system will accomplish constant movement, with resources pooling and making money while funding the unique visions of our community. A community that will, through what it builds, become a healthy entity, a self, a generation-spanning entropy stabilization mechanism. And like all entities, it seeks to survive.
</p>

The Telikos Platform
</p>
<p>
Telikos (TEK) is a platform for venture capital, and Adept (ADEPT) is a tokenized governance of shareholders that directs the platform. So far there is no platform that takes the productive capabilities of online project generation and unites it with the power of AMMs. Most platforms that operate staked liquidity pools do not create things of lasting value. Telikos is the solution.
</p>
<p>
We offer a low-entry opportunity to be part of the decentralized governing system that oversees the decision making processes related to Telikos. A platform that allows for the staking of project-staked bounties that passively generate yield through AMM liquidity pools. No stagnation, all flow. The idea and the utility generate income for the stakeholders while motivated contractors are encouraged to innovate. Competition without clutter.
</p>
<p>
After the initial Telikos lockdrop, members who hold ADEPT Tokens will contribute to the flow of ideas into the staking platform. On the Telikos Platform, tasks with sub-tasks are posted on an open forum for completion through a bounty system. Staking a bounty for an idea itself will generate passive interest to be distributed amongst the members of the platform itself via Telikos native tokens. On the Telikos Platform, the only boss is the competition among those who want to be paid to complete a task or subtask.
Each task’s bounty will be staked to liquidity pools within AMMs in order to generate yields. These yields are then driven into the resources for the project and also contribute to the wealth of the DAO itself. Telikos is a platform that pays people to use it and to take part in the DAO. The processes and the flows of user resources in Telikos are as transparent and accessible as the blockchain itself, while maintaining a layer of security to ensure the smooth transition of ideas and assets between parties. Once an idea is complete, the ones who staked the idea share profits, the person who completes the task is paid, and a small percentage of yields from bounties go back into the DAO.
Simply put, the Telikos platform combines the power to move resources around quickly, efficiently, and equitably on the Blockchain with the infinite opportunities of an open-venture freelance platform (such as UpWork or Fiver). Soon, there will be more computers than people. Already, much of the traditional stock market relies on machine-to-machine trading. Why not take this energy and convert it into the realization of utility in cyberspace and provide long-term benefits for skilled freelancers?
Whoever has a dream for a utility or algorithm — whether human or nonhuman — can access, work, and profit in Telikos.
</p>

Telikos DAO
No one likes the “Jezz Bezos model.”
The position of Telikos is to nurture ideas and have a vested interest not just for profit, but so those creative incentives are aligned between delegators and laborers. The potential for DAOs to disrupt the traditional hierarchies of capital accumulation and liquidity has been evidenced in DAOs like Swerve. A system of equitable bounding curves ensures that the founders of Telikos must remain committed to the project. The founders believe it will outlive us all by harnessing the magic of the living system.
The success of the Telikos platform will be made possible through the unique governance system of the Telikos DAO. There is almost nothing a DAO cannot do. The Telikos system will be a simplification of existing DAO DeFi solutions like Plasma. We believe Telikos will be made strong and reliable because it will be made up of technicians, dreamers, and investors who think beyond the limitations of the current system and into the future. And, together creating stable growth through big-picture thinking and a commitment to utility over baseless speculation.
</p>
<p>
By locking Telikos token with Ethereum in a liquidity pool, Telikos DAO members will generate Adept token. Adept is the governance token for the Telikos DAO. Holders of the Adept token can take part in the development of tasks on the Telikos platform. The DAO will be responsible for the issuance of the smart contracts which dictate the functioning of the platform. The DAO will also provide a system for conflict-resolution between parties utilizing the platform.
100 initial members will decide the rate of growth and future of the DAO and nurture the plenitude of projects that will be under its umbrella, including the Telikos platform itself.
</p>
<p>
Telikos Bounding Curves
The most effective forms of consensus are those that convert speculation into security or utility.
Both the Initial Generation Event (IGE) of the Telikos token itself and staking of bounties within the Telikos platform will distribute yields to individuals (or other token holding entities) via bonding curves. Bonding curves are pre-calculated mathematical systems that dictate the relationship between price and token supply.
Telikos bonding curves align and propel the ethos for the Telikos project itself. The Telikos bonding curves are a system to reward early adoption, while dis-incentivizing premature divesting or exits, in the endeavor to create a more stable value for the Telikos token. Those who latch onto an idea early, and stay with the idea as it grows, will benefit most from its success. The bonding curve of the initial lockdrop, where the members of the DAO come together, is the first bonding curve cycle for Telikos. By locking up Ethereum, participants are generating Telikos tokens that will seed the initial value of the DAO itself.

Epilogue
Traditional systems grow more strained every passing moment, while technology clamors to fill every gap. Decentralized finance paves the way for decentralized assets of every kind. Now we must begin developing the framework for a safe and equitable place to start ventures and fulfill tasks/bounties.
Telikos has a simple mission: to unite dreams, utility, and productivity in one place, uninhibited by extensive hierarchies, governed by the participants and coalesced into a self-perpetuating entity to evolve with time and fund the creation of a prosperous future — a dream machine.
